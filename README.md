# MY-SOCIAL-FOX-INTERNSHIP-
For this internship, three tasks were assigned:

Task 1:Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

This is a machine-learning project for Email Spam Detection. The goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate model that can classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) messages. By utilizing various machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods, we aim to create a reliable solution to combat the persistent problem of email spam.

Task 2:Unemployement Analysis With Python

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on unemployment analysis using Python. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize unemployment trends over time, identify factors influencing unemployment rates, and gain valuable insights into the job market.

Task 3:Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting car prices using various features and attributes. The goal is to build an accurate regression model that can estimate car prices based on factors like make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant specifications.
